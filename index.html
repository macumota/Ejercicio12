                <p>Roger Federer has bowed out of the Australian Open with a shock four-set loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas</p>
                <p>Federer's chances of winning a third consecutive Australian Open title were ended as the 20-year-old came of age on Rod Laver Arena.</p>
                <p>The Greek, who was not born when Federer made his professional debut, has rapidly established himself as one of the most exciting up-and-coming talents in the game and backed it up spectacularly with a 6-7 (11) 7-6 (3) 7-5 7-6 (5) victory to move through to a first slam quarter-final.</p>
                <p>Federer had not lost a match at Melbourne Park since a semi-final defeat by Novak Djokovic in 2016 but his often-brilliant forehand was wayward, especially at the big moments, and he failed to take four set points in the second set which might well have changed the outcome.</p>

                <p>For the first time all evening, Tsitsipas looked overwhelmed as he stepped out for the on-court interview, saying: "I'm the happiest man on earth right now. I cannot describe it.</p>
                <p>"From the very beginning it was very important to keep that mindset, to believe in yourself, believe in your capabilities.</p>

                <p>"Roger is a legend of the sport, so much respect for him. He showed such good tennis over the years. I've been idolising him since the age of six.</p>
                <p>"It was a dream come true just being on Rod Laver facing him. Winning at the end, I cannot describe it."</p>
                <p>"I had an aggressive mindset from the start, stayed in the moment, got first serves in and tried to press. I didn't lose my patience and that was the key.</p>
                <p>"I showed fighting spirit and had most of the crowd supporting me. I haven't seen such a large crowd all my life. The atmosphere, the vibes and the energy shown to Roger and me today was indescribable."</p>
